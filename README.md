# Airport Groups

This directory contains a web service and app for defining groups of airports.  The backend service is located in ./backend/airport-groups.  The frontend web app is located in ./frontend/web-elm.  See the README.md files in those two directories for instructions how how to build and run the web app. (It's best to build and run the backend first.)
