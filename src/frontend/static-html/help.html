<h1>Airport Groups</h1>
<p>
  Airport Groups is a simple web app to showcase a possible method for
  creating groups of airports.
  Here's a screen shot of the app.
</p>

<p>
  You use the upper portion of the page to define your groups. To make sure
  you've defined your groups
  correctly, push the Run button and check the output in the lower portion
  of the page.
</p>

<h2>Simple First Examples</h2>

<p>
  Here's the defintion of a very simple group.
</p>


<code>
  g1 = {FAA:SFO};<br>
  print(g1);
</code>

<p>
  If you enter this into input field of the app and then push the Run button,
  you'll see this displayed.
</p>


<code>
  g1 = {FAA:SFO}
</code>

<p>
  In the first line of your input, you defined a group, called "g1", that
  consists of a single airport having the FAA code SFO.  In the second line,
  you told the app to print the definition of g1.
</p>

<p>
  Here's a slightly more complicated example:
</p>

<code>
  g1 = {FAA:SFO, FAA:OAK};<br>
  g2 = {ICAO:KTEB};<br>
  g3 = g1 + g2;<br>
  print(g3);
</code>


<p>And its output:</p>

<code>
  g3 = {FAA:TEB,FAA:OAK,FAA:SFO}
</code>

<p>
  Now for some explanations.   Airports are specfied by a code type
  (either ICAO, IATA or FAA),
  followed by a colon, followed
  by the code. You define a group of airports
  by listing them between braces. The airports must be separated by a commas.

  You can give a group a name by entering it on the left hand side of an
  equals sign.

  To print the definition of a group, use the print command.

  All commands are separated from each other with semi-colons;
</p>

<p>
  The third line of the second example, "g3 = g1 + g2", shows how to combine
  groups with the plus sign, or union operator.
</p>

<p>
  You now know the basics of how to define and print simple groups.  In the
  next section, you'll see examples that introduce other group operators.
