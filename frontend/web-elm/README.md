# Airport Groups Web App Frontend

This dirrectory contains the frontend for airport groups.


## To build and run the frontend


Install [elm](https://http://elm-lang.org/).


Build:

`$ elm make airport-group-editor.elm`

The previous command creates an `idex.html` in the current directory. Open that file in your browser to start the Airport Groups web app. Enter an airport group program in the upper text entry box. Press the Run button to run your code.  See `airport-groups/backend/airport-groups/README.md` for additional information.
